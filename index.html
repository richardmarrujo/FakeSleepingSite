                <h3>Tips for Staying Awake</h3>
                <li>Get enough sleep: The most effective way to stay awake during the day is to get enough sleep at night. Aim for at least
                7-8 hours of sleep each night to help you feel well-rested and energized during the day.</li>
                
                <li>Stay hydrated: Dehydration can cause fatigue and drowsiness, so make sure you're drinking enough water throughout the
                day. Try to drink at least 8-10 glasses of water per day, and avoid sugary or caffeinated beverages that can cause
                crashes later on. </li>
                
                <li>Move around: Physical activity can help increase blood flow and wake up your body and mind. Take short breaks throughout
                the day to stretch, walk around, or do some light exercises.</li>
